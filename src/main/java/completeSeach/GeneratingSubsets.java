/**
 * Complete search is a general method that can be used to solve almost any
 * algorithm problem. The idea is to generate all possible solutions to the problem
 * using brute force, and then select the best solution or count the number of
 * solutions, depending on the problem.
 * Complete search is a good technique if there is enough time to go through
 * all the solutions, because the search is usually easy to implement and it always
 * gives the correct answer. If complete search is too slow, other techniques, such as
 * greedy algorithms or dynamic programming, may be needed.
